# Stacked Generalization for Model Based Geostatistics

## How To Install

## What and Why

This library contains a set of functions to run stacked generalization ensemble models within the context of IHME's model-based geostatistic framework.

The translation of this code base into a fully fledged R-package is still in progress and the existing documentation exploits internal IHME shared knowledge (updated documentation is on the todo list).
